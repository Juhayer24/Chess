# 🎮 Chess Game with Hand Gesture Volume Control - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Installation Complete!

Your chess game now has hand gesture volume control! Here's everything you need to know:

### 🚀 How to Start

#### Option 1: Complete Experience (Recommended)
```bash
# Activate your virtual environment and start both chess + gesture control
source .venv/bin/activate
python launcher.py
```

#### Option 2: Just Chess Game (with built-in gesture control)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

#### Option 3: Only Gesture Control
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python launcher.py --gesture-only
```

### 🎯 Hand Gesture Controls

Once running, you'll see a small camera window alongside your chess game:

- **📌 Pinch Close**: Bring thumb and index finger together → **Lower Volume**
- **📌 Pinch Far**: Spread thumb and index finger apart → **Higher Volume**  
- **📌 Smooth Control**: Volume changes smoothly based on finger distance

### ⌨️ Keyboard Controls (Gesture Window)

- **Q**: Quit gesture control
- **R**: Reset volume to current system level
- **D**: Toggle debug information on/off

### 🔧 Current Status

✅ **All Dependencies Installed**: opencv-python, mediapipe, numpy, pygame  
✅ **Camera Detected**: Ready for gesture control  
✅ **macOS Audio Control**: Using AppleScript  
✅ **Threading Integration**: Gesture control runs alongside chess game  
✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Chess works even if camera unavailable  

### 📋 What You'll See

1. **Chess Game Window**: Your main chess game interface
2. **Gesture Control Window**: Small camera feed showing your hand tracking
3. **Volume Bar**: Visual indicator of current volume level
4. **Hand Tracking**: Blue/green dots on your fingertips with connecting line

### 🎮 Playing Chess with Gesture Control

1. Start the launcher: `python launcher.py`
2. Position your hand 1-2 feet from the camera
3. Play chess normally in the main window
4. Control your computer's volume by pinching your fingers
5. The volume changes will affect your entire system

### ⚡ Performance Tips

- **Good lighting** improves hand tracking accuracy
- **Single hand use** works best (algorithm optimized for one hand)
- **Stable hand position** gives smoother volume control
- **Close other camera apps** (Zoom, Skype) for better performance

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

#### Camera Issues
```bash
# Test camera access
python -c "import cv2; print('Camera works:', cv2.VideoCapture(0).isOpened())"
```

#### Volume Not Changing
- Check System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Camera
- Allow Terminal/Python to access camera
- Try adjusting finger distance (closer = quieter, farther = louder)

#### Gesture Control Window Not Showing
- This is normal when running in background mode
- Gesture control still works without visual feedback
- Try: `python launcher.py --gesture-only` for standalone mode

### 📁 Project Files

- `launcher.py` - Main launcher script
- `main.py` - Chess game with integrated gesture control  
- `gesture_control.py` - Standalone gesture control module
- `test_integration.py` - Test script to verify functionality

### 🎯 Advanced Usage

#### Calibration Mode
```bash
python gesture_control.py
# Then press 'C' in the gesture window to calibrate finger distances
```

#### Debug Mode
- Press 'D' in gesture control window to see tracking information
- Shows finger distance, volume levels, and FPS

#### Different Sensitivity
Edit `gesture_control.py` lines ~107-109:
```python
self.closest_distance = 30     # Minimum distance (volume 0%)
self.farthest_distance = 200   # Maximum distance (volume 100%)
self.smoothing_factor = 0.2    # Volume change speed
```

### 🎊 Enjoy!

- Play chess against human or AI opponents
- Control your computer's volume with hand gestures
